They require to replace both the indices and query processing algorithms currently deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial objects show that our RL based index outperforms the R-Tree and its variants in terms of query processing time.\n","date":1668470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668470400,"objectID":"0d0e7e7cda3f2afe5095b85de685fa9c","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-11-15-sigmod-23/","publishdate":"2022-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-11-15-sigmod-23/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Gu Tu for publishing the paper “Effectively Learning Spatial Indexes with a Support for Updates” at SIGMOD 2023.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on Learned R-tree accepted at SIGMOD 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “Learned Index Benefits: Machine Learning Based Index Performance Estimation” at VLDB 2023.\nIndex selection remains one of the most challenging problems in relational database management systems. To find an optimum index configuration for a workload, accurately and efficiently quantifying the benefits of each candidate index configuration is indispensable. As materializing each index configuration candidate and physically executing queries are infeasible, most of index tuners rely on the cost estimations from optimizer with “what-if” API. However, “what-if” based index benefit estimations have the following two limitations. Firstly, they generate significant errors, which compromise index recommendation quality. Secondly, generating query plans and benefit estimations for each candidate index configuration takes a considerable amount of time. To address the two challenges in index selection, we propose an effective end-to-end machine learning based index benefit estimator. In particular, we propose novel feature extraction and encoding techniques that do not rely on “what-if” call to generate query plan for each index configuration candidate. In addition, we design an attention mechanism to address index interaction issue and aggregate the impacts of different query operations. Finally, we leverage transfer learning technique to improve the estimator’s learning ability for adaption to new database. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different workloads, and extensive experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms “what-if” based index benefit estimations in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, integrating our method into existing index selection algorithms can significantly improve index recommendation quality.\n","date":1660521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660521600,"objectID":"051bea8de3810221b3c5cf4b4a7b29bd","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-08-15-vldb-23/","publishdate":"2022-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-08-15-vldb-23/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “Learned Index Benefits: Machine Learning Based Index Performance Estimation” at VLDB 2023.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on Learned Index Selection accepted at VLDB 2023","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jingyi Yang","Peizhi Wu","Gao Cong","Tieying Zhang","Xiao He"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

It becomes a challenge for cloud providers to benchmark different DBMS for a specific database instance without having access to the underlying data. One viable solution is to leverage a query workload, which contains a set of queries and the corresponding cardinalities, to generate a synthetic database with similar query performance. Existing methods for database generation with cardinality constraints, however, can only handle very small query workloads due to their high complexity and encounter challenges when handling join queries. In this work, we propose SAM, a supervised deep autoregressive model-based method for database generation from query workloads. First, SAM is able to process large-scale query workloads efficiently as its complexity is linear in the size of the query workload, the number of attributes and the attribute domain size. Second, we develop algorithms to obtain unbiased samples of base relations from the deep autoregressive model and assign join keys in a way that accurately recovers the full outer join of the target database. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SAM is able to efficiently generate a high-fidelity database that not only satisfies the input cardinality constraints, but also is close to the target database.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"933983f9b8671d447fb59e43fa7576b9","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Yang Jingyi and Wu Peizhi for publishing the paper “SAM: Database Generation from Query Workloads with Supervised Autoregressive Models” at SIGMOD 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on database generation accepted at SIGMOD 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “QueryFormer: A Tree Transformer Model for Query Plan Representation” at VLDB 2022.\nMachine learning has become a prominent method in many database optimization problems such as cost estimation, index selection and query optimization. Translating query execution plans into their vectorized representations is non-trivial. Recently, several query plan representation methods have been proposed. However, they have two limitations. First, they do not fully utilize readily available database statistics in the representation, which characterizes the data distribution. Second, they typically have difficulty in modeling long paths of information flow in a query plan, and capturing parent-children dependency between operators.\nTo tackle these limitations, we propose QueryFormer, a learning-based query plan representation model with a tree-structured Transformer architecture. In particular, we propose a novel scheme to integrate histograms obtained from database systems into query plan encoding. In addition, to effectively capture the information flow following the tree structure of a query plan, we develop a tree-structured model with the attention mechanism. We integrate QueryFormer into four machine learning models, each for a database optimization task, and experimental results show that QueryFormer is able to improve performance of these models significantly.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"a16cd7e86dc7de907daa4fe0b624e9f5","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-03-01-vldb-22/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-01-vldb-22/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “QueryFormer: A Tree Transformer Model for Query Plan Representation” at VLDB 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on Query Plan Representation accepted at VLDB 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yue Zhao","Gao Cong","Jiachen Shi","Chunyan Miao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
