Spatial indexes like R-tree greatly accelerate the query performance and can be effectively constructed through packing, i.e., loading all data into the index at once. However, existing R-tree packing methods rely on a set of fixed heuristic rules, which may not be suitable for different data distributions and workload patterns. To address the limitations of existing R-tree packing methods, we propose PLATON, a top-down R-tree packing method with learned partition policy that explicitly optimizes the query performance with regard to the given data and workload instance. We develop a learned partition policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and carefully make design choices for the MCTS exploration strategy and simulation strategy to improve algorithm convergence. We propose a divide and conquer strategy and two optimization techniques, early termination and level-wise sampling, to drastically reduce the MCTS algorithm’s time complexity and make it a linear-time algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of PLATON over existing R-tree variants and recently proposed learned/workload-aware spatial indexes.\n","date":1693008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693008000,"objectID":"5bbc578314ab0946c45077a08d43c9ef","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-platon/","publishdate":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-platon/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Jingyi for publishing the paper “PLATON: Top-down R-tree Packing with Learned Partition Policy” at SIGMOD 2024.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on learned R-tree packing accepted at SIGMOD 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Songsong, Yile for publishing the paper “Lemo: A Cache-Enhanced Learned Optimizer for Concurrent Queries” at SIGMOD 2024.\nWith the expansion of modern database services, multi-user access has become a crucial feature in various practical application scenarios, including enterprise applications and e-commerce platforms. However, if multiple users submit queries within a short time frame, it can result in potential issues such as redundant computation and query concurrency. Unfortunately, most existing multi-query optimization methods, which aim to enhance query processing efficiency, have not adequately addressed these two problems, especially in the setting where multiple queries are being executed concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel method named Lemo for the multi-query optimization problem. Specifically, we propose a novel value network to predict latencies of concurrent queries as the foundation model for query plan generation. Furthermore, we introduce a shared buffer manager component to cache the intermediate results of sub-queries. The shared buffer manager applies a novel replacement policy to maintain the cached buffer with the objective of maximizing the opportunity for the reuse of the cached sub-queries. Based on the shared buffer, our proposed value network can incorporate the cached results into cost estimation to further guide Lemo in generating query plans, thus avoiding redundant computation. Lemo has been integrated into PostgreSQL and experiments conducted on real datasets with PostgreSQL show that it outperforms all the baselines in efficiency.\n","date":1693008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693008000,"objectID":"3eb3d27242c7d655d87d0fca9ac00e4a","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-lemo/","publishdate":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-lemo/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Songsong, Yile for publishing the paper “Lemo: A Cache-Enhanced Learned Optimizer for Concurrent Queries” at SIGMOD 2024.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on multi-query optimization accepted at SIGMOD 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Zizhong for publishing the paper “Selectivity Estimation for Queries Containing Predicates over Set-Valued Attributes” at SIGMOD 2024.\nSelectivity estimation aims to estimate the size of query results size accurately and efficiently. Despite being a well-researched area for decades, most existing estimators are designed to handle comparison predicates over numeric and categorical data. Nevertheless, Set-valued data are ubiquitous in many applications such as information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, these estimators may not be effective for handling predicates over set-valued data. In this work, we presents novel techniques for selectivity estimation on queries involving predicates over set-valued attributes. We first propose the set-valued column factorization problem, whereby each each set-valued column is converted to multiple numeric subcolumns, and set containment predicates are converted to numeric comparison predicates. This enables us to leverage any existing estimator to perform selectivity estimation. We then develop two methods for column factorization and query conversion, namely ST and ST-hist. We integrate ST and ST-hist into three estimators, Postgres, Neurocard, and DeepDB. We then conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis by comparing our approach against three baselines across three different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods exhibit superior estimation accuracy while maintaining high efficiency compared to the baseline techniques.\n","date":1693008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693008000,"objectID":"0b7344688df1fa5bf189d2ec807a9a22","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-set/","publishdate":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-set/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zizhong for publishing the paper “Selectivity Estimation for Queries Containing Predicates over Set-Valued Attributes” at SIGMOD 2024.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on selectivity estimation for set-valued data accepted at SIGMOD 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":["Zizhong Meng","Xin Cao","Gao Cong"],"categories":null,"content":"Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1693008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693008000,"objectID":"d79cadcbe3d33a5b4d5c49b79aad0b32","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/publication/sigmod24-set/","publishdate":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sigmod24-set/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

To find an optimum index configuration for a workload, accurately and efficiently quantifying the benefits of each candidate index configuration is indispensable. As materializing each index configuration candidate and physically executing queries are infeasible, most of index tuners rely on the cost estimations from optimizer with “what-if” API. However, “what-if” based index benefit estimations have the following two limitations. Firstly, they generate significant errors, which compromise index recommendation quality. Secondly, generating query plans and benefit estimations for each candidate index configuration takes a considerable amount of time. To address the two challenges in index selection, we propose an effective end-to-end machine learning based index benefit estimator. In particular, we propose novel feature extraction and encoding techniques that do not rely on “what-if” call to generate query plan for each index configuration candidate. In addition, we design an attention mechanism to address index interaction issue and aggregate the impacts of different query operations. Finally, we leverage transfer learning technique to improve the estimator’s learning ability for adaption to new database. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different workloads, and extensive experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms “what-if” based index benefit estimations in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

It becomes a challenge for cloud providers to benchmark different DBMS for a specific database instance without having access to the underlying data. One viable solution is to leverage a query workload, which contains a set of queries and the corresponding cardinalities, to generate a synthetic database with similar query performance. Existing methods for database generation with cardinality constraints, however, can only handle very small query workloads due to their high complexity and encounter challenges when handling join queries. In this work, we propose SAM, a supervised deep autoregressive model-based method for database generation from query workloads. First, SAM is able to process large-scale query workloads efficiently as its complexity is linear in the size of the query workload, the number of attributes and the attribute domain size. Second, we develop algorithms to obtain unbiased samples of base relations from the deep autoregressive model and assign join keys in a way that accurately recovers the full outer join of the target database. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SAM is able to efficiently generate a high-fidelity database that not only satisfies the input cardinality constraints, but also is close to the target database.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"933983f9b8671d447fb59e43fa7576b9","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Yang Jingyi and Wu Peizhi for publishing the paper “SAM: Database Generation from Query Workloads with Supervised Autoregressive Models” at SIGMOD 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on database generation accepted at SIGMOD 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “QueryFormer: A Tree Transformer Model for Query Plan Representation” at VLDB 2022.\nMachine learning has become a prominent method in many database optimization problems such as cost estimation, index selection and query optimization. Translating query execution plans into their vectorized representations is non-trivial. Recently, several query plan representation methods have been proposed. However, they have two limitations. First, they do not fully utilize readily available database statistics in the representation, which characterizes the data distribution. Second, they typically have difficulty in modeling long paths of information flow in a query plan, and capturing parent-children dependency between operators.\nTo tackle these limitations, we propose QueryFormer, a learning-based query plan representation model with a tree-structured Transformer architecture. In particular, we propose a novel scheme to integrate histograms obtained from database systems into query plan encoding. In addition, to effectively capture the information flow following the tree structure of a query plan, we develop a tree-structured model with the attention mechanism. We integrate QueryFormer into four machine learning models, each for a database optimization task, and experimental results show that QueryFormer is able to improve performance of these models significantly.\n","date":1646784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784000,"objectID":"a16cd7e86dc7de907daa4fe0b624e9f5","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-03-01-vldb-22/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-01-vldb-22/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “QueryFormer: A Tree Transformer Model for Query Plan Representation” at VLDB 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on Query Plan Representation accepted at VLDB 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":["Yue Zhao","Gao Cong","Jiachen Shi","Chunyan Miao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
